GroBoy
======

A Nintendo Gameboy Emulator,

To compile you will need cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)

##### To install cmake on ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

##### Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joakim-d/GroBoy.git
```
 
##### Finally compile the project:

```bash
cd GroBoy
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

```
 
##### Optional : 
The GUI front-end is made with Qt (http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
you will need the libraries (Qt 5.5) if you want the front-end software as well!
Note that you can open the CMakeLists.txt file with QtCreator as a project!
